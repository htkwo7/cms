<div class="text">
<p>My concept is to repurpose and recontextualise content from an existing online publishing source — an archive — to question the systems of categorisation and order that archives usually hold.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>My topic originated from where I sourced the reissue of <a href="https://telephonepublishing.com/author/matthewlholden/"><i>Lockjaw</i></a> — the <i>NGV Book Fair</i>, where there was also a book launch for the publication. This lead to research surrounding public announcements and advertising. The resulting content for the project is a series of announcement posters — which seemed like an appropriate medium — sourced from the online database of the <a href="https://www.slv.vic.gov.au/">State Library of Victoria</a>. The <bold>Resource Type</bold> tag is pictures, and the <bold>Subject</bold> tag is advertising.</p>
	<br/>   
  <p>My intent is to change the nature of archiving, which is associated with tagging, systems of organisation and categorization, to change how archives are usually viewed and used through removing all elements of order. The layered imagery and dragging promotes interactivity — something inherent to online mediums — and relies on the interpretations of the user to alter content. This links to the idea of a reissue, through producing a different response each time the site is used, becoming a newer and altered version of the original content. The layout of the site references the artwork in the book through being a ‘combination of text and image’ which overlay and overlap.</p><br/>
  
  <p style="margin-left:100px;">That was how it was meant to be, a seamless blend of words and images. That’s the key to <i>Lockjaw</i>, not privileging the word over the image — abstract from an interview with <bold>Matt Holden</bold>.</p> <br/>
  
  <p>This also references the idea of a conversation between elements, which is seen in the nature of an email trail — this was also a large part of my publication’s content.
