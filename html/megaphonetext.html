<p>My concept is to repurpose and recontextualise content from an existing online publishing source—an archive—to question the systems of categorization and order that archives usually hold.<br/>
	My topic originated from thinking where I sourced the reissue of Lockjaw. This was the NGV Book Fair—there was also a book launch for the publication. This lead me to research into advertising and public announcements. I came to the conclusion that a poster is an appropriate medium for both of these outcomes. Resulting from this process, my content for the project is a series of posters sourced from the online database of the State Library of Victoria. The resource type tag in the search is pictures, and the subject tag is advertising.
	<br/> 
  My intent is to change the nature of archiving, which is associated with tagging, systems of organisation and categorization. The final site contests how archives are usually viewed and used through removing these elements of order, and through layering and dragging it becomes about interactivity from the user and relies on their own interpretations of how they view and change the content. This links to the idea of a reissue, through producing a different response each time the site is used, becoming a newer and altered version of the original content.
	A common theme throughout the research—not just linked to archiving but also seen in online stores and search engines—was systems of organising content, such as the ability to search tags by their media. This resulted in intentionally selecting a single type of media to be displayed on the main page—the poster.
The layout of the site references the artwork in the book through being a ‘combination of text and image’ which overlay and overlap. <br/>
  
  “That was how it was meant to be, a seamless blend of words and images. That’s the key to Lockjaw, not privileging the word over the image”. — Matt Holden. <br/>
  
  This also references the idea of a conversation between elements, which is seen in the nature of an email trail—this was also a large part of my publication’s content.
