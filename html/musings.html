   <h4>
    Titled <i>‘musings’</i>, the idea is to take all kinds of thoughts, ideas and posts (creative or humorous) and give them a place all together. The content is mostly visual media, the aim is to take the idea of ‘musing’ away from writing and allow the viewer to understand that musing is more than writing, and more than academic thoughts. <br><br>Originally I imagined there would be no grid structure as such, but the 1 scrolling column allows for; Content is sourced from any and all online platforms; it includes anything that fits the theme of idea sharing, or thought provoking work. The nature of the media means that the viewer is free to make any connection (if any) between media, or can lead them of their own train of thought, or musings.
